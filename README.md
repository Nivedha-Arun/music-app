## Reflection

I have developed this application in 2 days and my main goal being able to give you an understanding about the knowledge I have in these technologies.

In the given time I was able to develop,

1. Home : Home Screen with Songs list and respective album name, It has search functionality enabled.

2. Create Playlist : Create your own playlist from the songs list

3. My Playlist : Select the stored playlist and perform actions like search, shuffle, add, delete.
